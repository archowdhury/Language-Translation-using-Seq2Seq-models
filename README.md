# Language Translation using Seq2Seq models

In this project we'll use a Seq2seq model to translate English to Bengali. Please feel to use any other language file instead. Just the file name needs to be changed. The rest of the code will work as is.

You can download any language model from here : http://www.manythings.org/anki/

The model is based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture using "Teacher Forcing" to train the model
